# GitHub Upload Instructions for CortexOS

This guide will help you upload the CortexOS repository to GitHub.

---

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your system
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed (optional but recommended)

---

## Method 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install GitHub CLI

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gh

# macOS
brew install gh

# Windows
winget install GitHub.cli
```

### Step 2: Authenticate

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with your GitHub account.

### Step 3: Create Repository and Push

```bash
cd /path/to/cortexos_github

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: CortexOS experimental neural operating system"

# Create GitHub repository and push
gh repo create cortexos --public --source=. --push

# Or for private repository
gh repo create cortexos --private --source=. --push
```

### Step 4: Add Description and Topics

```bash
gh repo edit --description "Experimental six-phase neural operating system with cognitive architecture - unfinished research project"

gh repo edit --add-topic neural-networks
gh repo edit --add-topic cognitive-architecture
gh repo edit --add-topic ai-research
gh repo edit --add-topic experimental
gh repo edit --add-topic python
```

---

## Method 2: Using GitHub Web Interface

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `cortexos`
3. Description: `Experimental six-phase neural operating system with cognitive architecture - unfinished research project`
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Local Repository

```bash
cd /path/to/cortexos_github

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: CortexOS experimental neural operating system"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cortexos.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Add Topics

1. Go to your repository page on GitHub
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics: `neural-networks`, `cognitive-architecture`, `ai-research`, `experimental`, `python`
4. Save changes

---

## Method 3: Using Git with SSH

### Step 1: Set Up SSH Key (if not already done)

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Start ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the public key to GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Paste your public key
4. Click "Add SSH key"

### Step 2: Create Repository and Push

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub first (via web interface)

cd /path/to/cortexos_github

# Initialize and push
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: CortexOS experimental neural operating system"

# Add remote with SSH (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/cortexos.git

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Post-Upload Configuration

### Add Repository Description

Edit the "About" section on your GitHub repository page:

**Description:**
```
Experimental six-phase neural operating system with cognitive architecture. Research project exploring hybrid neural-symbolic AI. Status: Unfinished/Experimental.
```

**Website:** (optional)
```
Leave blank or add project documentation site
```

**Topics:**
- `neural-networks`
- `cognitive-architecture`
- `ai-research`
- `experimental`
- `python`
- `machine-learning`
- `symbolic-ai`
- `research`

### Enable Issues and Discussions

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Under "Features":
   - ✅ Enable Issues
   - ✅ Enable Discussions (recommended for Q&A)
   - ✅ Enable Projects (optional)

### Create Initial Issue/Discussion

Consider creating a pinned issue or discussion:

**Title:** "Project Status and Call for Contributors"

**Body:**
```markdown
## Current Status

CortexOS is an experimental cognitive architecture that never achieved stable deployment. This repository contains:

- ✅ Complete source code for all 28 components
- ✅ Six-phase architecture implementation
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ REST API with 30+ endpoints
- ❌ Stable end-to-end deployment
- ❌ Working UI integration

## Looking For

- Developers who can get this working in their environment
- Researchers interested in cognitive architectures
- Contributors to fix deployment issues
- Documentation improvements

## Getting Started

See [README.md](README.md) and [WHAT_COULD_HAVE_BEEN.md](WHAT_COULD_HAVE_BEEN.md) for full context.

If you make progress, please share your approach!
```

## Recommended Repository Settings

### Branch Protection (Optional)

If you want to protect the main branch:

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Recommended settings:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

### Labels

Create useful labels for issues:

- `deployment` - Deployment-related issues
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `help-wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `good-first-issue` - Good for newcomers
- `research` - Research-related discussions
- `architecture` - Architecture improvements

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates

If you continue development:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin main
```

### Creating Releases

When you reach milestones:

```bash
# Tag a release
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial experimental release"
git push origin v0.1.0

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh release create v0.1.0 --title "v0.1.0 - Initial Release" --notes "Experimental release of CortexOS architecture"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Large Files

If you get errors about large files:

```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M

# Add to .gitignore if needed
echo "large_file.bin" >> .gitignore

# Remove from git if already committed
git rm --cached large_file.bin
git commit -m "Remove large file"
```

### Authentication Issues

```bash
# For HTTPS, use personal access token instead of password
# Generate token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

# For SSH, verify connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

---

## Next Steps

After uploading:

1. ✅ Verify all files are present
2. ✅ Check README renders correctly
3. ✅ Test clone and setup on fresh machine
4. ✅ Add topics and description
5. ✅ Enable Issues and Discussions
6. ✅ Create initial issue/discussion
7. ✅ Share with relevant communities (optional)
8. ✅ Monitor for contributions
