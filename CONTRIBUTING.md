# Contributing to CortexOS

Thank you for your interest in CortexOS! This project is experimental research code that never achieved stable deployment, but contributions are welcome to help realize its potential.

## Project Status

**Important:** This is not an actively maintained production project. It's an experimental cognitive architecture that encountered significant deployment challenges. Contributions should be made with the understanding that:

- The original implementation never achieved stable end-to-end functionality
- Integration between components remains problematic
- Platform dependencies cause cross-compatibility issues
- No guarantees are made about merge timelines or project direction

## How You Can Help

### 1. Bug Fixes & Deployment Solutions

If you manage to get CortexOS working in your environment:

- **Document your setup** - OS, Python version, dependencies, configuration
- **Share your fixes** - Submit PRs with platform-specific fixes
- **Update documentation** - Help others replicate your success

### 2. Architecture Improvements

The six-phase cognitive architecture is the core innovation:

- Propose alternative phase designs
- Suggest better integration patterns
- Improve component modularity
- Enhance interpretability features

### 3. Documentation

Help make the codebase more accessible:

- Clarify unclear sections
- Add component-level documentation
- Create tutorials or examples
- Improve API documentation

### 4. Research Applications

Novel uses of the architecture:

- Apply to specific domains (NLP, computer vision, etc.)
- Test alternative cognitive models
- Benchmark against other architectures
- Publish research findings

### 5. Component Extraction

Individual components may be valuable standalone:

- Extract and package useful components
- Create standalone libraries
- Improve component APIs
- Add comprehensive tests

## Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Read the documentation**
   - [README.md](README.md) - Project overview
   - [WHAT_COULD_HAVE_BEEN.md](WHAT_COULD_HAVE_BEEN.md) - Project history and lessons
   - [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) - Architecture details
   - [ORIGINAL_README.md](ORIGINAL_README.md) - Setup instructions

2. **Understand the challenges**
   - Platform dependencies (Windows/Linux/WSL2)
   - Integration complexity
   - Deployment fragility
   - Known failure modes

3. **Set realistic expectations**
   - This may not work out of the box
   - Integration is harder than component fixes
   - Breaking changes may be necessary

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/cortexos.git
   cd cortexos
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/deployment-issue
   # or
   git checkout -b feature/improved-resonance
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, documented code
   - Add tests where possible
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Follow existing code style

4. **Test thoroughly**
   - Test individual components
   - Test integration if possible
   - Document your test environment
   - Note any platform-specific behavior

5. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: Resolve WSL2 path compatibility in PathManager
   
   - Replace hardcoded Windows paths with os.path
   - Add platform detection
   - Test on Ubuntu 22.04 WSL2
   - Update documentation"
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Describe what you changed and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Document your test environment
   - Explain any breaking changes

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Document functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

```python
async def process_data(data: dict, context: str) -> dict:
    """
    Process incoming data with given context.
    
    Args:
        data: Input data dictionary
        context: Processing context identifier
        
    Returns:
        Processed data dictionary
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If data format is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide examples where helpful
- Document known issues and limitations
- Keep README files up to date

## Final Notes

CortexOS is an ambitious experiment that didn't achieve its original goals. Your contributions might be what finally makes it work—or they might just advance the ideas for the next attempt. Either outcome is valuable.

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. Even if CortexOS never fully works, the effort to understand and improve it advances the field of cognitive architectures.

**Remember:** The value is in the journey, the learning, and the ideas—not necessarily in a perfect final product.
